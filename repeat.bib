   variation is noticed in the number of alleles per locus for all the
   populations. Using alternate summary measures, we have observed that
   genotype distributions at the six VNTR loci apparently conform to
   their respective Hardy-Weinberg predictions. Multilocus genotype
   profiles of the individuals in each of the three populations suggest
   that the VNTR alleles are independently segregating with the exception
   of the two linked loci D1S76 and D1S77. Lack of fit of all VNTR loci
   to one particular model of mutational change, either the Infinite
   Allele Model or the Stepwise Mutation Model, suggests more than one
   mechanism for production of new VNTR alleles. This study also
   indicates that increased heterozygosity at VNTR loci in comparison to
   protein and blood group loci may lead to more accurate estimates of
   genetic distance.}

  note = {Five tandem repeat loci were studied in humans and
   chimpanzees using 
   VNTR probes derived from human DNA. Shared alleles were found at three
   loci and were often the modal allele in one species but never in both.
   There was no difference in the mean number of alleles per locus.
   However, these species exhibited substantially different levels of
   gene diversity, with chimpanzees monomorphic at two loci. Evidence of
   reduced variability in chimpanzees corroborates earlier comparisons
   using isozymes and plasma proteins. Molecular mechanisms, population
   dynamics, or both may be responsible for these differences. Equal
   numbers of alleles per locus may reflect high mutation rates. By one
   test, chimpanzees were out of equilibrium at one locus, which may
   reflect a typing error or population substructure. The long divergence
   time, and the high probability of backward mutations, precludes
   accurate estimation of genetic distance between these species.}

  note = {We have analyzed the allele frequency distribution at the
   hypervariable locus 3' to the apolipoprotein B gene (ApoB 3' VNTR) in
   five well-defined human populations (Kacharis of northeast India, New
   Guinea Highlanders of Papua New Guinea, Dogrib Indians of Canada,
   Pehuenche Indians of Chile, and a relatively homogeneous Caucasian
   population of northern German extraction) by using the PCR technique.
   A total of 12 segregating alleles were detected in the pooled sample
   of 319 individuals. A fairly consistent bimodal pattern of allele
   frequency distribution, apparent in most of these geographically and
   genetically diverse populations, suggests that the ApoB 3' VNTR
   polymorphism predates the geographic dispersal of ancestral human
   populations. In spite of the observed high degree of polymorphism at
   this locus (expected heterozygosity levels 55\%-78\%), the genotype
   distributions in all populations (irrespective of their tribal or
   cosmopolitan nature) conform to their respective Hardy-Weinberg
   predictions. Furthermore, analysis of the congruence between expected
   heterozygosity and the observed number of alleles reveals that, in
   general, the allele frequency distributions at this locus are in
   agreement with the predictions of the classical mutation-drift models.
   The data also show that alleles that are shared by all populations
   have the highest average frequency within populations. These findings
   demonstrate the potential utility of highly informative hypervariable
   loci such as the ApoB 3' VNTR locus in population genetic research, as
   well as in forensic medicine and determination of biological
   relatedness of individuals.}

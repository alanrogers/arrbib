Note that absence of LOH in the vicinity of the linked marker on chromosome 2 argues against this being a tumor suppressor. Instead, they speculate that possibly the mutation gives rise to instability at many different loci (including microsatellites) and this somehow relates to tumorigenesis. NOTE that it's estimated that microsatellites are located approximatley one every 100 kb in the genome (useful fact). Speculate that the mutation may be involved somehow in causing inaccurate DNA replication.

   Note = {Nice review of the two major classes of helper T cells: Th1 and Th2. Th1 generally seem to be more involved in stimulating cytotoxic T cells, while Th2 generally are more involved in stimulating B cells, although the distinction is not completely clear-cut. Also, each subset tends to produce different cytokines (as expected, given that they stimulate different cells) -- Th1 produces IL-2 (which is also an autocrine factor -- stimulates further Th1 production) and IFN-gamma, TNF-beta. Th2 produces IL-4 (again, this is an autocrine factor) and IL-3, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13.  Says it is likely that the MAIN function of Th1 is to promote phagocyte-mediated responses against infections, but also some Th1 can acquire cytolytic capacity themselves, and the IL-2 and IFN-gamma they produce can activate killer T cells.  IL-4 produced by Th2 is a major inducer of B cells. Note that both populations are derived from mature naive CD4 cells that mostly are producing IL-2. Note that IL-2 activates 3 major transcription factors, Stat1, 3 and 4.  IL-4 causes development of Th2 cells by activating Stat6. Note that low antigen concentrations tend to induce Th1, while high concentrations --> Th2. Some evidence that antigen presentation by macrophages and dendritic (primarily of intracellular bacteria and viruses) cells tends to --> Th1, while B cell presentation (primarily of helminthic parasites, extracellular pathogens, and allergens) --> Th2. **FILED UNDER 'IMMUNOGENETICS'**},

   She also discusses alternatives, including an "assimilation"
   hypothesis in which there is gene flow but little or no
   migration. Current fossil evidence indicates that modern humans are
   seen first in Africa, then in Asia, and then in Europe. But note
   that the Asian fossil record is considered to be especially poor
   and spotty.  Earliest modern Homo remains are the Skhul and Qafzeh
   remains in Israel, which are about 100,000 years old -- these could
   represent an initial migration out of Africa, etc.  But note that,
   while these remains are clearly not archaic, they "fall out of the
   range" of modern human craniometric variation as well.  Also, they
   are NOT associated with modern tool assemblages. Notes coexistence
   of Neandertal and modern humans in the Near East, but says evidene
   for possible hybridization is equivocal. Note that Upper
   Paleolithic tools are seen at about the SAME time in Africa and
   Europe (40,000 years ago), instead of earlier in AFrica as one
   might expect with an African origin. She concludes that fossils are
   consistent with, but do not clearly substantiate, an African origin
   for Europeans.  Evidence for hybridization between modern and
   Neandertals in Europe is suggestive, but not at all conclusive (no
   surprise). Notes that H. erectus persisted much longer in eastern
   Asia than elsewhere in the world (and note very recent, 1996 or
   1997, report of a VERY recent H. erectus specimen in
   China). Mentions presence of modern H. sapiens in Australia >50,000

   shovel-shaped incisors, etc.) is not really that
   convincing. Frquencies of these traits in populations vary a lot,
